# Tech Lead vs. Engineering Manager

It is prevalent for companies to mix the Tech Lead and Engineering Manager roles. Although both roles have some overlap, their focus is different: the Tech Lead is in charge of the *System* while the Engineering Manager is in charge of the *People*.

If the team is small and the leader has much experience as an Engineering Manager and Tech Lead, the same person might perform both roles. However, as the system and team grow in size and complexity, there might be an opportunity to have different people for each role.

The following is a non-exhaustive list that exemplifies some of the different responsibilities of each role:

| [Tech Lead](TechLead.md) (System) | [Engineering Manager](EngineeringManager.md) (People)|
| :--- | :--- |
| Technical Excellence and Innovation| Career Planning, Promotions and Coaching |
| Architecture and System Integration | Headcount Planning and Hiring |
| Tech Mentoring, Adoption and Alignment | Team Planning and Delivery |
| Technical Spikes and Experiments​ | Objectives, Performance and Feedback |
| Code Reviews and Feedback | One on Ones |
| System Design Presentations​ | Participation in Technical Decisions |
| Technical Capacity Planning​ | Cascading Communications​ |
| Production Issues Escalation​ | Team Building Activities and Culture​ |
| System SLAs, Metrics & Monitoring​ | Team Protection and Happiness​ |
| Platform Direction, Patterns and Practices | Team Productivity and Metrics​ |
| Alignment with other Tech Leads​ | Alignment with other Dev Managers​ |
| Hands-On Coding 30% to 70% of the Time | Hands-On Coding 0% to 30% of the Time |
| System Roadmap (shared)​ | System Roadmap (shared)​ |
| Development Process (shared)​ | Development Process (shared)​ |
| Team Visibility and Recognition (shared) | Team Visibility and Recognition (shared)​ |
| Ability to Act as Engineering Manager when Required | Ability to Act as Tech Lead when Required |

The last point on each role highlights that the lists are not mutually exclusive, and therefore, many of the points from one side are also important on the other. An Engineering Manager who needs help understanding the team's technical challenges will not succeed at the role. The same is true for a Tech Lead who needs help understanding the career paths of the engineers on the team. 

Having said that, although an Engineering Manager needs to be able to act as a Tech Lead and vice versa, it is also critical for them to focus and excel at the right things. Although there is a clear overlap and an opportunity for collaboration, both positions must know who is responsible for what to avoid conflicts and misunderstandings.
