# Managing Managers

## Introduction

When you reach the manager's ladder higher, some of your direct reports will be other managers. 
The manager's actions impact their teams more, so you need to set expectations differently.

How do you assess the managing skills of other managers?
Managers always face conflicting forces, and a big part of their job is to keep things balanced.
To set the right expectations and measure the manager's success, it is important to evaluate how balanced the following areas are:


## Delivery

Managers constantly face push from the Business to deliver value quickly while feeling the pressure from the team to deliver high-quality solutions.

| Business Impact | Technical Excellence |
| :--- | :--- |
| Speed | Quality |
| Customer Feedback | Code Maintainability |
| Opportunity Cost | Tech Debt Cost |


## Goals

Aligning the team's and individual's goals is critical to ensure a scenario where the team delivers value to the organization while its members progress in their careers. The manager should create a win-win scenario where both sides (team and individual) get something in return.

| Team | Individuals |
| :--- | :--- |
| Business Needs | Career Focus |
| Team Expectations | Personal Interests |
| Group Performance | Individual Performance |


## Planning

Although short-term vs. long-term planning is sometimes seen as a "business vs. tech" type of discussion (see [Delivery](#delivery)), this is not always true. The manager often must balance the trade-offs between a quick business (or technical) solution and a long-term one. Do you know if we can fix this bug quickly or invest in a proper technical solution? Do we create a quick throw-away spike or invest in a well-designed feature?

| Short-Term | Long-Term |
| :--- | :--- |
| Weekly Plan | Quarterly Plan |
| Spike | Well Thought Out Design |
| Solve Quickly | Solve Properly |


## Oversight

Managers usually have difficulty delegating effectively without losing control over their teams. Staying connected to the details without interfering is undoubtedly one of the most challenging tasks for a manager (especially for managers of managers). Managers must empower the team to make decisions while being on top of what is happening.

| Control | Delegation |
| :--- | :--- |
| Micromanaging | Empowerment |
| Connected to Details | Big Picture |
| Auditing | Trust |

## Relationships

Most managers will excel at building relationships with their direct reports (managing down) and with their supervisors (managing up). Still, they must pay more attention to their relationships with the rest of the organization (managing across). Lack of focus on horizontal relationships risks cross-team initiatives and reduces the manager's visibility of the team's impact.

| Vertical (Managing Down / Up) | Horizontal (Managing Across) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Supervisor(s) | Stakeholders |
| Direct Reports | Peers / Other Teams |
| Indirect Reports | Users |

## Conclusion

Assessing managers requires a slightly different perspective. Their actions have a more significant impact on their teams; therefore, they are in charge of keeping things balanced.

Managers should balance each area---delivery, goals, planning, oversight, and relationships---sustainably over time. Not all areas must be balanced the same way; the team's seniority, company culture, and business context might move the arrow closer to one side or the other. The green area is a range and not a single value. It is vital to avoid getting too close to any of the extremes.

In summary, understanding how each manager performs in every area is an excellent way to assess their performance and, therefore, a great opportunity to have meaningful career conversations with them.
